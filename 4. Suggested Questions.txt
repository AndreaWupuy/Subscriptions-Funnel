Answer the following questions:

•	I have heard from customer support that we have a very large number of customers that complain about errors
when trying to buy our membership. What’s going on? 

•	Do we need to improve the checkout process? If so, what do we do?

•	I need a monthly analysis for the board for tomorrow. Do we have any seasonality or any other trends I need 
to be aware of?
