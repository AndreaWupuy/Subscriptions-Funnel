Currently the company offers different types of subscriptions for their different usersâ€™ needs such as one-medical, prime video movies and gift cards. 
The most popular subscription types are annual and monthly, accounting for 92.48% of total checkouts. According to customer service there seems to 
be a problem when customers try to make a purchase. The purpose of the report is to determine whether the error is a user or business issue.

According to the analyze data, only 34.56% of the customers make it to the checking section, the rate is not unusual for the company as the membership 
services are very popular. Based on the analysis, 68.34% of the users that go to the checkout section receive an error message. It is estimated that 
69% of the 2962 total errors are mainly due to user mistakes, such as the number field, the year and the last name not being filled out correctly, 
each of which has 1220, 684 and 148 errors.

There are several ways to ensure the user experience is smothered when purchasing membership. During digitization of the card information, pop-out 
messages could show that there is a missing field. Or there could be a progress bar on top to show how much of the payment information needed is 
completed. Another option may be to add functionality where users can scan their card to the website/app or add a digital wallet. In that way, the 
payment process would be more efficient and human typing mistakes could be avoided.

Additionally, there were some concerns about the existence of seasonality in the data. It is safe to say that with the data given, there is no 
indication of seasonal trends. Nevertheless, November is the peak month for errors with 1702. This may be because of Black Friday deals where users 
are looking to get the most discounts possible even if that means subscribing to a membership.
